# Problem Statement: Predicting the Rent of a property

### The Dataset shared has two files â€“ Train & Test. The data contains the list of individual properties that were available for rent in one of the states in the United States across a period of few months. You need to build a model on the Train dataset and validate the accuracy on the Test dataset using an algorithm of your choice. Most of the columns are self-explanatory but feel free to reach out to me in case of any queries.
