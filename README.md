Udacity Machine Learning Advanced Nanodegree Program has 3 Projects:

1. **Reinforcement Learning**: *Train a Smart Cab to Drive* - In this project, reinforcement learning techniques are applied for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.

2. **Deep Learning**: *Image Classification* - for the CIFAR-10 dataset which consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The techniques used are normalization of the images, one-hot encoding of the labels, building a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 

3. **Machine Learning Capstone Project** : *Brain Tumor Classification* - classification of three types of brain tumors (i.e., meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor) in T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) images.
